# Task Manager Application (Console-based)

## Project Title: Task Manager

### Description
The Task Manager application is a simple console-based tool built in Java, designed to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks. It provides basic functionalities such as adding tasks, marking them as complete, viewing the task list, and deleting tasks.

### Key Features

1. **Add Task**: Users can add a new task to the list with a title and a brief description.
2. **Mark as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as complete when they finish them.
3. **View Tasks**: Display the list of tasks with their status (complete/incomplete).
4. **Delete Task**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
5. **Save and Load**: Implement basic file I/O to save tasks to a file and load them when the application starts.

### Additional Challenges

- **Implement Priority Levels**: Allow users to assign priority levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to tasks.
- **Add Due Dates**: Enable users to set due dates for tasks and notify them if a task is overdue.
- **Categorize Tasks**: Allow users to categorize tasks into different sections for better organization.

### Getting Started

To run the Task Manager application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the project from the repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Compile the Java files using the `javac` command: `javac *.java`
5. Run the application: `java Main`

### Usage

Upon running the application, users will be presented with a menu allowing them to perform various tasks. They can select options using the provided numeric keys and follow the prompts for adding, marking, viewing, or deleting tasks.

### File I/O

The application includes basic file I/O functionality to save tasks to a file (`tasks.txt`) and load them when the application starts. This ensures that users can persist their task data across sessions.

### Additional Notes

- The application is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, with a focus on core task management functionalities.
- Users can extend the application's capabilities by implementing additional features and enhancements based on their requirements.
