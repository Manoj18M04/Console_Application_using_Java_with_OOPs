Project Title: Task Manager

Description:
Create a simple console-based Task Manager application in Java. The application should allow users to manage 
their daily tasks efficiently. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete, view the list of tasks, 
and delete tasks.

Key Features:

	1.	Add Task: Users can add a new task to the list with a title and a brief description.
	2.	Mark as Complete: Users can mark tasks as complete when they finish them.
	3.	View Tasks: Display the list of tasks with their status (complete/incomplete).
	4.	Delete Task: Users can remove tasks from the list.
	5.	Save and Load: Implement basic file I/O to save tasks to a file and load them when the 
		application starts.

Additional Challenges:

	•	Implement priority levels for tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
	•	Add due dates for tasks and notify users if a task is overdue.
	•	Allow users to categorize tasks into different sections
